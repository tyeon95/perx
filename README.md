## Simple React Github user search

Temporarily hosted here: http://perx-react-test.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com

Using React Boilerplate: https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate - slightly overkill for this use-case but gets a lot of the groundwork setup

Testing with enzyme and jest

Redux for state management

Excluded `.env` from `.gitignore` since no security issues from exposing github api


#### Running locally:
- Setup: `yarn`
- Test: `yarn test`
- Run: `yarn start`
- Buiild: `yarn build`


Note: _Nice UI_ is relative ðŸ˜‰
